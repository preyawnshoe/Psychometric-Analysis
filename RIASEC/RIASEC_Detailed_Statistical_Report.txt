6. CAREER IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Based on the RIASEC analysis results, the following career development 
recommendations are suggested:

GROUP-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. INVESTIGATIVE FOCUS: With Investigative showing the highest mean score,
   consider programs emphasizing research, analysis, and scientific thinking.

2. DIVERSE INTERESTS: The range of dominant types suggests a diverse group with
   varied career interests - individualized counseling recommended.

3. CORRELATION PATTERNS: Strong correlations between certain types suggest
   exploring hybrid career paths that combine multiple interest areas.

INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

For each participant, career exploration should focus on their Holland Code 
and dominant interest patterns. Those with highly differentiated profiles 
may benefit from specialized career paths, while those with flat profiles 
might explore careers requiring diverse skills.

================================================================================
7. STATISTICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

ASSUMPTIONS:
• Participants responded honestly and accurately
• The RIASEC model appropriately captures career interests
• Sample is representative of the intended population

LIMITATIONS:
• Sample size of 16 may limit generalizability
• Cross-sectional data provides snapshot rather than developmental trends
• Cultural and contextual factors may influence responses

RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
• Internal consistency appears adequate based on correlation patterns
• No systematic response biases detected in the data
• Score distributions show appropriate variability

================================================================================
8. TECHNICAL APPENDIX
================================================================================

STATISTICAL METHODS:
• Descriptive statistics calculated using pandas and numpy
• Normality testing performed using Shapiro-Wilk test
• Outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) method
• Correlation analysis using Pearson product-moment correlation

RIASEC CATEGORY MAPPING:
The 42 assessment items were mapped to RIASEC categories based on 
Holland's theoretical framework and standard RIASEC inventories.

DATA PROCESSING:
• Responses coded as: Yes=3, Maybe=2, No=1
• Category scores calculated as mean of relevant items
• Missing data: None detected
